# SinnohRegionPokedex

This is my final programming project submission for my 'COGS 18: Intro to Python' class. 

This program contains a built-in database of every single pokemon from the Sinnoh Region!
Users are able to quickly and swiftly locate information on different pokemon within the database.


There are 3 kinds of search features offered by this Pokedex program:
  1. Search database by pokemon name
  2. Search database by pokemon type
  3. Search database by pokemon national index #
  
  
Meeting the Grading Requirements:

    1 Jupyter notebook
        -ProjectNotebook.ipynb
    4 python files
        -pokemonClass.py
        -pokemonObjects.py
        -functions.py
        -test_functions.py
    3 original functions
        -findWithName()
        -findWithType()
        -findWithNdex()
    1 original class, with 5 original methods
        -Pokemon
            *getPokemonName()
            *getPokemonType()
            *getPokemonNdex()
            *setPokemonType()
            *setPokemonNdex()
    3 original function tests
        -test_findWithName()
        -test_findWithType()
        -test_findWithNdex()


EXTRA CREDIT:
    - In my python project, I wanted to make my pokemon program feel more lively and inviting (almost like a game), so I learned how to add background music from watching tutorials online. If you run the main program, you will instantly notice (if you have your volume loud enough) that peaceful pokemon music begins playing in the background as you utilize the pokemon program hahaha! 
    - Other than self-teaching myself how to use coding concepts not taught in class, I also have uploaded my project onto Github. In doing so, I'd make sure to maintain a good version-control routine thoughout the development of this project.
    
    

Overall, I really had a great time working on this project. This was my first big python project so I really hope you enjoy it! 
Gotta catchem' all!!

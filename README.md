# SinnohRegionPokedex

This is my final programming project submission for my 'COGS 108: Intro to Python' class. 

This program contains a built-in database of every single pokemon from the Sinnoh Region!
Users are able to quickly and swiftly locate information on different pokemon within the database.

There are 3 kinds of search features offered by this Pokedex program:
  1. Search by pokemon name
  2. Search by pokemon type
  3. Search by pokemon national index #

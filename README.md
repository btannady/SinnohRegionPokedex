# SinnohRegionPokedex

This program contains a built-in database of every single pokemon from the Sinnoh Region!
Users are able to quickly and swiftly locate information on different pokemon within the database.


There are 3 kinds of search features offered by this Pokedex program:
  1. Search database by pokemon name - Enter a pokemon name as input, program will then display information on that pokemon.
  2. Search database by pokemon type - Enter a pokemon type(s) as input, program will then display information on related pokemon.
  3. Search database by pokemon ndex # - Enter a pokemon ndex as input, program will then display information on that pokemon.
The fourth option offered is basically to just end the program.

        -pokemonClass.py
        -pokemonObjects.py
        -functions.py
        -test_functions.py

        -findWithNdex()
        
    1 original class, with 5 original methods

EXTRA CREDIT:

    - In my python project, I wanted to make my pokemon program feel more lively and inviting 
    (almost like a game), so I learned how to add background music from watching tutorials 
    online. If you run the main program, you will instantly notice (if you have your volume loud 
    enough) that peaceful pokemon music begins playing in the background as you utilize the 
    pokemon program hahaha! 
    
   

Overall, I really had a great time working on this project. This was my first big python project so I really hope you enjoy it! 

Gotta catchem' all!!
